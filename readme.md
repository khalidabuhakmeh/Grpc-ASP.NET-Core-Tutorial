## Grpc ASP.NET Core Server & Client Example

This repository holds a self-contained example of a Grpc client and server app
configured to run on macOS.

**Note: macOS doesn't support TLS on HTTP2 (yet), so the client and server only communicate over HTTP2 without TLS.**

## Plugin

If you are using [JetBrains Rider](https://jetbrains.com/rider), be sure to install the [Protocol Buffer Editor Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14004-protocol-buffer-editor). It is so nice.
